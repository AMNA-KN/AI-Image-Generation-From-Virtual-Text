# 🤖 **AI IMAGE GENERATION FROM VIRTUAL TEXT** 🎨

The *'AI Image Generation From Virtual Text'* is an innovative project that harnesses the power of OpenCV, Pytesseract, and Hugging Face to create AI images from virtual text inputs. Users can input keywords to be displayed on the screen. Pytesseract extracts text from the image/frame, adds the specified keyword to the prompt, and sends it to the Hugging Face text-to-image model to generate the corresponding image.

## 📝 Features

- **Write image keyword :** Use your finger to write any keyword on the screen.
- **Text Recognition :** Extract text from images using Pytesseract.
- **Image Generation :** Generate images based on the extracted text and keywords.
- **Real-time Processing :** Process and display images in real-time.
